Is the U.S. Military ready for WW3?

Answer1:
Does it matter? people adapt. I wonder how we'll deal with all the chinese and muslims sabotaging infrastructure, though.

Answer2:
Military recruitment shortfalls are admitted to be as high as 30%. The US military recruiting crisis is well publicized. The failure to meet goals to retain military personnel currently serving is even worse than the missed recruiting goals of new personnel. Washington DC also understands that any attempt at a forcible draft of American citizens would be answered by the American people with a level of violence the federal government is not capable of responding to.
Federal agencies are also hamstrung by Diversity, Inclusion and Equity quotas that exclude capable and intelligent candidates. The federal government is composed of very mediocre people who have done nothing in their lives besides graduate from a liberal university on their daddies money.
The federal government in Washington DC is losing the consent of the governed. The federal government does not have enough door kickers to force compliance from the American people.

Is it normal to hate the country you were born and raised in? What causes that? And why do I hate the English so much?

Answer1:
Blame your parents. They were traitors to their country. All for a few shekels. You're the disgusting product of their degeneracy.

Answer2:
White people abandoned Christianity for oppulence and hedonism. Their culture revolves around consumption - alcohol, drugs, fighting, vomiting/urinating on streets, hook up culture. They have no money saved and blame other cultures for all their own problems. Meanwhile these other cultures all have money, are buying second homes with 2 cars parked outside while bongs are too busy waiting for payday to pay their rent.
